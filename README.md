# ```Learning_to_see_in_the_dark_Fastai```
This was the implementation of the paper Learning to see in the dark and a casual project by our team mates. Rather using the `RAW` format we converted our images into `jpg` format and built a model on that. 

The results weren't that much good compared to the actual paper as we werent using the RAW format, but this is a quick implementation of the paper by using Fastai.
